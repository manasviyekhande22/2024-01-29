    <h2><center>WELCOME TO THE PLANTS PLANTE</center></h2>
    <p><center><b>Plants are beneficial to us in a variety of ways. Plants offer seeds such as wheat, rice, corn, and other foods that we consume on a daily basis. Plants provide us with oxygen and take in the carbon dioxide that we release. This helps maintain a balance in the ecosystem and reduces global warmingYou know that humans develop, or gradually change, from infants to quite different, sexually mature adults. You also know that meiosis in your own ovaries or testes produces haploid eggs or sperm, which must join in fertilization to become a new individual. Each of us, of course, began as that single cell made when a sperm united with an egg. Now, through mitosis and the miracle of development, we are made of trillions of cells organized into tissues, organs, and organ systems, which make us complex, amazing, active, individual beings. None of us would doubt that we have changed significantly since we began as single cells. Each of us has a unique identity that we keep throughout our entire lives, until death marks our end. We may give birth to other individuals by producing eggs or sperm, but only if they join with other sperm or eggs to produce new, separate lives.</center></b></p>
